All the Markdown files (*.md) in this folder are the test cases.
Note that the "RUN" directives in these test cases are wrapped inside Markdown's comment,
so they will not show up in Github's web interface. You can either click the "Raw" button
(in the web interface) to view them or simply just clone the repo.
